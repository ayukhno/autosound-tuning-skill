# TODO — maintainer's backlog

Work that is understood but not yet due. Not the roadmap: `ROADMAP.md` is product direction for
people who use the method, this is engineering debt for whoever maintains it. An item here carries
**what would make it due**, because an item whose trigger is "when someone remembers" is the kind
that gets found again three months later as a surprise.

## S-001 · `deployment.py` cannot tell a DECLARED pin from a split

**Due when:** the first tuning project is pinned to a version and still being worked on. Not before.

**State today.** `rew_tool/deployment.py` refuses (exit 3) whenever two reachable deployments are
different commits. That is right for a split nobody chose, and wrong for a pin somebody chose on
purpose: a run held at `v3.0.33` for reproducibility will be refused every session, on the thing it
is doing correctly. A check that cries wolf on a deliberate arrangement teaches people to skip it —
and this module's own `verdict()` already carries that argument, in the paragraph explaining why
the grouping key is the sha and not the path. The same reasoning applies one level up, and this
item is where it lands.

**The form is already decided**, and it is the one shape on this machine that never drifted:
`autosound-tcc` carries the skill as a submodule, so the CONSUMER records the sha it expects and
git compares the record against what is checked out. Generalise that:

* the project records the version it is pinned to — a field beside the other project facts
  (`rew_tool/project.py`, `project.json`), not a new file and not a second place;
* a reachable deployment matching the record reads as **agreement**, not disagreement;
* a deployment that does NOT match the record is a harder failure than today's exit 3 — the run
  says which version its numbers were computed on, and something else is on the path;
* a project with no record behaves exactly as now. Absent is not the same as satisfied, and a
  silent default would put this module back where it started.

**What must not happen:** the pin becoming declarable in a file nobody compares against. That is
the failure this module was written for — the 2026-08-13 rule about the personal symlink lived in
a memory file, was contradicted by `install.sh:774`, and nothing noticed for thirteen days. A
declaration is only worth having where a check reads it.

**Trigger is live, not written down:** `deployment.py` already names this gap in its refusal when
one of the disagreeing checkouts is held (`DETACHED`), and points here. It arrives with the case.

**Raised** 2026-08-29, out of autosound-hub HUB-006, by the person whose run was pinned.
